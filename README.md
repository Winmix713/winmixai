# WinMix TipsterHub – Integrated Intelligence Platform (Phases 3–9)

WinMix TipsterHub is an end-to-end football analytics and prediction platform that now consolidates every capability delivered across phases 3 through 9 into a single cohesive system. The application blends automated data ingestion, model evaluation, cross-league intelligence, monitoring, and self-improving market collaboration features on top of a modern React + Supabase stack.

---

## 🏗️ Platform Architecture

| Layer | Technologies | Responsibilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Frontend** | React (Vite), TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn-ui, TanStack Query, React Router | SPA experience with feature-specific dashboards (jobs, analytics, models, cross-league, monitoring, phase 9). Manages routing, state, visualizations, real-time feedback, and user interactions. |
| **Integrations** | Supabase SDK, Supabase Edge Functions | Secure data operations (auth, tables) and custom Edge Functions for jobs, analytics, and phase 9 services. Edge Functions expose REST-like endpoints that the client consumes via the `supabase.functions.invoke` calls. |
| **Domain Logic** | `/src/integrations`, `/src/lib`, `/src/types` | Encapsulates domain-specific contracts (job definitions, model metrics, monitoring KPIs, phase 9 intelligence) and shared utilities that standardize payloads across features. |
| **Analytics & Automation** | Supabase tables, background jobs | Phase 3 cron scheduling, Phase 4 feedback loop aggregation, Champion/Challenger orchestration, temporal decay, and collaborative market learning pipelines. |

Key data flow:
1. **Scheduled Jobs (Phase 3)** wake via Supabase Edge Functions and emit job state/log updates that the frontend consumes via TanStack Query.
2. **Feedback Loop (Phase 4)** pushes prediction outcomes back into Supabase tables, feeding analytics, model comparisons, and dashboards.
3. **Champion / Challenger Framework (Phase 6)** monitors model families, triggering promotions, demotions, and retraining requests.
4. **Cross-League Intelligence (Phase 7)** unifies league feeds to produce correlation heatmaps, radar differentials, and strategic insights.
5. **Monitoring & Visualization (Phase 8)** exposes system health, data freshness, compute loads, and anomaly detection dashboards.
6. **Collaborative Market Intelligence (Phase 9)** layers temporal decay weighting, self-improvement loops, and market blending to enhance predictive precision.

## 🚀 Feature Overview by Phase

### Phase 3 – Scheduled Jobs & Automation
- Jobs list, status controls, manual triggers, log viewers (`/jobs`).
- Supabase Edge Functions: `jobs-list`, `jobs-logs`, `jobs-toggle`, `jobs-trigger`.
- UI components: `JobStatusCard`, `JobLogsDialog`, adaptive skeleton loaders.

### Phase 4 – Feedback Loop & Model Evaluation
- Analytics workspace (`/analytics`) with model performance charts, feedback forms, and post-match evaluation flows.
- Integrations for performance snapshots, calibration metrics, automated retraining flags.
- Supabase-driven feedback loop that closes the model refinement process.

### Phase 6 – Champion / Challenger Framework
- Model management hub (`/models`) for champion/challenger insights, promotions, audit history, and feature experiments.
- Domain types under `src/types/models.ts` and service helpers in `src/integrations/models/service.ts`.

### Phase 7 – Cross-League Intelligence
- Cross-league dashboard (`/crossleague`) with correlation heatmaps, league comparison radar charts, and meta-pattern surfacing.
- Smart refetching, league filters, and storyline highlights for analysts.

### Phase 8 – Monitoring & Visualization
- Real-time monitoring center (`/monitoring`) showing compute loads, system health cards, anomaly watchlists, and SLA tracking.
- Visual components under `src/components/monitoring`.

### Phase 9 – Advanced Collaborative Market Intelligence
- Holistic intelligence suite (`/phase9`) combining collaborative analysis, market integration, temporal decay, and self-improving loops.
- Modular components in `src/components/phase9` and API layer in `src/lib/phase9-api.ts`.
- Automated tests in `src/test/phase9.test.ts` covering core behaviors.

### Evaluation Logging & ID Tracking
- **Robust Prediction Tracking**: Every prediction gets a unique UUIDv4 for end-to-end tracking from prediction to result reconciliation.
- **CSV-based Event Sourcing**: Evaluation log stored as `/tmp/evaluation_log.csv` with atomic append operations for data integrity.
- **Schema**: `prediction_id,timestamp,model_version,team_a,team_b,predicted_result,actual_result,confidence`
- **Model Versioning**: Automatic git commit hash tracking or configurable model versions.
- **Result Reconciliation**: Separate workflow for logging actual results, enabling accuracy analysis over time.
- **Testing Suite**: Comprehensive test script (`test-evaluation-logging.ts`) validates logging, validation, and reconciliation workflows.
- **Retention Policy**: Safe to archive/delete rows older than 90 days for performance management.

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

The platform now includes Supabase Authentication with role-based access control (RBAC).

### User Roles
- **Admin**: Full system access including scheduled jobs and model management.
- **Analyst**: Can create predictions, access analytics, and view all dashboards.
- **User**: Read-only access to public predictions and match data.

### Authentication Features
- **Email/Password Sign-up & Sign-in**: Baseline authentication flow with validation.
- **Session Management**: Automatic token refresh and persistence via localStorage.
- **Protected Routes**: AuthGate component manages access control with configurable role requirements.
- **Public Demo Access**: Unauthenticated users can view matches, teams, leagues, and public predictions (read-only).
- **OAuth Support (Optional)**: Hooks for Google/GitHub authentication can be configured via Supabase dashboard.

### Creating Your First User
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/signup`
3. Register with email and password
4. Check your email for verification (Supabase sends confirmation emails)
5. Sign in at `http://localhost:5173/login`

The first registered user will be assigned the default 'user' role. To promote to admin:
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
UPDATE user_profiles SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

### Route Access Control
| Route Category | Authentication Required | Default Roles Allowed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public (`/`, `/login`, `/signup`) | ❌ No | All visitors |
| Demo Routes (`/predictions`, `/matches`, `/teams`, `/leagues`) | ❌ No (read-only) | All visitors |
| Protected Dashboards (`/dashboard`, `/analytics`, `/models`, `/monitoring`, `/phase9`) | ✅ Yes | admin, analyst, user |
| Job Management (`/jobs`) | ✅ Yes | admin, analyst |
| Prediction Creation (`/predictions/new`) | ✅ Yes | admin, analyst, user |

### Environment Variables
Configure authentication in your `.env` file (see `.env.example`):
```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project-id.supabase.co"
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your_anon_key_here"
```

Optional OAuth providers can be configured in the Supabase dashboard under Authentication > Providers.

---

## 🛠️ Local Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm or bun
- Supabase project (or Supabase CLI) configured with the matching schema & Edge Functions.

### Setup
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure with your Supabase credentials.
- Start the Vite dev server at `http://localhost:5173`.
- Ensure Supabase Edge Functions (`supabase/functions/*`) are deployed or running via `supabase functions serve` when testing job and analytics features locally.
- Apply database migrations including the new `user_profiles` table:
  ```bash
  supabase db push --project-ref <YOUR_PROJECT_ID>
  ```

### Testing

The project now includes unit, integration, end-to-end, and Supabase backend checks. Key commands:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm test` | Run Vitest unit and integration suites with coverage reporting (outputs to `coverage/`). |
| `npm run test:watch` | Execute Vitest in watch mode for rapid iteration. |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Launch Playwright browser flows (dev server is started automatically). |
| `npm run test:supabase` | Execute Deno-based validation for shared Supabase schemas and policies. |
| `npm run test:all` | Run Vitest coverage followed by Supabase backend checks. |

Coverage summaries are printed to the console and detailed HTML/LCOV reports land in `coverage/`. Playwright reads Supabase defaults from `playwright.config.ts`; override via environment variables when targeting real backends.

---

## 🔮 Prediction Engine

The repository now ships with `prediction_engine.py`, a standalone inference harness that powers both the CLI tooling and any future server-side integrations. The engine performs strict feature validation against `model_config.yaml`, resolves the active serialized model from `models/model_registry.json`, and keeps the hydrated estimator cached via a singleton so disk I/O occurs only on the very first request. Every successful inference automatically records a row via `ml_logging.log_prediction_event`, ensuring downstream analytics (or audits) always have a traceable prediction ID.

### CLI usage

```bash
python prediction_engine.py \
  --team-a "Arsenal" \
  --team-b "Chelsea" \
  --features-json '{"team_form_index": 12, "opponent_form_index": 9, "avg_goals_scored": 2.1, "avg_goals_conceded": 0.8, "injury_count": 1, "rest_days": 5, "tempo_rating": 78}'
```

- Results stream to `stdout` as JSON so they can be piped into other tools.
- Validation errors (missing/extra features) exit with code `1`; filesystem or registry issues exit with code `2`.
- Prediction events are appended to `logs/prediction_events.csv` with the highest-probability scoreline.

### Response schema

The CLI and library variants both return the following JSON structure so callers can rely on a consistent contract:

```json
{
  "prediction_id": "0fba9b43-6f06-4045-a8d4-6c94074e9885",
  "model": {
    "name": "baseline_scoreline_model",
    "version": "2024.11.0",
    "path": "models/baseline_scoreline_model.pkl"
  },
  "ordered_features": ["team_form_index", "opponent_form_index", "avg_goals_scored", "avg_goals_conceded", "injury_count", "rest_days", "tempo_rating"],
  "feature_vector": [12.0, 9.0, 2.1, 0.8, 1.0, 5.0, 78.0],
  "probabilities": {"0-0": 0.18, "1-0": 0.22, "0-1": 0.11, "2-1": 0.15, "1-2": 0.09, "2-0": 0.12, "0-2": 0.08, "Other": 0.05},
  "predicted_result": "1-0",
  "confidence": 0.22,
  "context": {
    "team_a": "Arsenal",
    "team_b": "Chelsea"
  }
}
```

Supplementary Python unit tests live under `tests/test_prediction_engine.py` and assert the singleton loader semantics along with payload validation safety nets.

---

## 📣 Integration Notes
- All feature branches (Phases 3 → 9) have been merged sequentially into `integration/merge-phases-3-4-6-7-8-9` with navigation, routes, and domain types normalized to avoid duplication.
- Shared UI elements (e.g., `Sidebar`, `App.tsx`) have consolidated imports and route registrations to surface every phase feature consistently.
- Documentation now reflects the unified system so reviewers and stakeholders can evaluate the entire product surface area from a single reference.

## 🤖 Model Training Pipeline

The platform includes a robust CLI tool for training and managing machine learning models with full reproducibility and versioning support.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Train a model with default settings
python train_model.py

# Train with custom data
python train_model.py --data-path data/custom_dataset.csv

# Dry run (train but don't save)
python train_model.py --dry-run

# Use custom random seed
python train_model.py --random-seed 123
```

### Training Workflow

1. **Prerequisites**: Python 3.9+ is required

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install required Python packages with pinned versions
   ```bash
   # It's recommended to use a virtual environment
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare Data**: Ensure your training dataset CSV contains all features defined in `model_config.yaml`
   - Default location: `data/training_dataset.csv`
   - Must include all `input_features` and the `target_column`

4. **Configure Model**: Edit `model_config.yaml` to specify:
   - `model_type`: `LogisticRegression` or `DecisionTree`
   - `input_features`: List of feature column names
   - `target_column`: Target variable name
   - `hyperparameters`: Model-specific parameters

5. **Run Training**: Execute the training script
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

6. **Check Results**: 
   - Trained model saved to `models/<algorithm>_<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>.pkl`
   - Registry updated in `models/model_registry.json`
   - Evaluation metrics printed to console

### Features

- **Reproducibility**: Fixed random seed (default: 42) ensures identical results across runs
- **Versioning**: Timestamped model files prevent accidental overwrites
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score for all models
- **Registry Management**: JSON registry tracks all trained models with metadata
- **Error Handling**: Clear validation messages for missing features or malformed data
- **Dry Run Mode**: Test training without saving artifacts

### Model Registry

Each trained model is registered with:
- `id`: Unique UUID for the training run
- `timestamp`: ISO 8601 timestamp
- `metrics`: Performance scores (accuracy, precision, recall, f1_score)
- `parameters`: Hyperparameters used for training
- `model_path`: Relative path to the serialized model file
- `status`: Model status (`candidate` by default, can be promoted to `active`)
- `random_seed`: Seed used for reproducibility
- `features`: List of input features
- `target`: Target column name

### Troubleshooting

**Missing columns error**: Ensure your CSV contains all features listed in `model_config.yaml`

**Import errors**: Verify all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Registry corruption**: The script handles corrupted registries automatically by creating a new one
